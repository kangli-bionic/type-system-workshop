The syntax of our language is mostly based on racket.

The implementation of the type checker is heavily aided by [_Types and Programming Languages_ by Benjamin C. Pierce](https://books.google.com/books/about/Types_and_Programming_Languages.html?id=ti6zoAC9Ph8C).

The implementation of the parser and interpreter include ideas from [Northwestern's Programming Languages course](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/321-2015-fall/) by Robby Findler and [University of Washington's Programming Languages course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b) by Dan Grossman available on Coursera.
